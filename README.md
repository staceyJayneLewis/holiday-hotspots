# HOLIDAY HOTSPOTS

UX STRATEGY
The focus of this site is to allows users to search for their next holiday destination that suits their needs by displaying information such as attractions, accommodations and restaurants. The website will also display information about recommended and popular holiday destinations and packages for the users that are still undecided on where they want to go. 
The business goals for the site owner is to get users to choose a travel package from the site and/or from it's sponsors. The site is used to provide results in a manner that is visually appealing and user friendly so that the page doesn’t look overloaded with information but also displays the holiday destinations information well.  Why do we need a site for this? Well, with the internet being the most popular and preferred method of purchasing holidays nowadays we need to adapt to the digital way of displaying information to target our audience. 
The value a website could bring is more customers for the site owner/sponsors and convenience for the users as many customers would rather use a website to search for their holidays now and you have all the packages supplied online in one place so you can view at home and not be inconvenienced by having to find a travel agent store. 
Who are the target audience? The site's target audience would be anyone of all ages planning a holiday and needing to search different destinations to help find what they are looking for and can refine the search by 5* hotels for example.
What I think would be worth doing is providing the users with the most popular destinations as suggestions/recommendations for the users that are looking for ideas on somewhere different to go. It is crucial in having a search function for the user to interact with to search for their destination and reveal many results of top reviewed destinations or 5* rated hotels etc. 

Why would customers want to use this website?
For the consumers I have conducted a survey on Survey Monkey (link) to analyze consumer opinions and behaviors and based on this research it is clear that…
This is a website users would return to and may return to numerous times depending on how many holidays they want to book or if they are undecided on a destination or looking for suitable holiday package. 
It would even be something that the site owner uses themselves as it is applicable to everyone so the site owner would benefit from the commission on package purchases but also from being a user of the site themselves if needed.
	- What they like about the style/design?
	- When users go to the website, where do they go first?
	- Ask users why would they/would not use the website?
	- In terms of the site owner's needs we need to look at what makes a good ecommerce experience, after some independent reseach I noticed on many articles including on the travel engine website (link included in resources section) What facilities does it need? - travel packages
	- What does it compare to other websites? - the content relavant?


Why are we special?
Who else are doing it and how well are they doing it?
What are other sites doing?
What are the pros/cons of what they are doing?
What could be better?
What are the tech considerations?
Is the technology appropraite?
Do theirs look better because of better resources?

<!-- In this section, you will include a few paragraphs providing an overview of your project.
Essentially, this part is your "sales pitch".

At this stage, you should have a name for your project so use it!
Don't introduce the project as a "portfolio project" for the diploma.

In this section, describe what the project hopes to accomplish, who it is intended to target, and how it will be useful to the target audience. -->

## Wireframes

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.

## Features

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project,
and describe each in a sentence or so.

You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user,
focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve,
and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

IMPORTANT: Remember to always include a screenshot of each individual feature!
