# HOLIDAY HOTSPOTS

UX STRATEGY
The focus of this site is to allows users to search for their next holiday destination that suits their needs by displaying information such as attractions, accommodations and restaurants. The website will also display information about recommended and popular holiday destinations and packages for the users that are still undecided on where they want to go. 
The business goals for the site owner is to get users to choose a travel package from the site and/or from it's sponsors. The site is used to provide results in a manner that is visually appealing and user friendly so that the page doesn’t look overloaded with information but also displays the holiday destinations information well.  Why do we need a site for this? Well, with the internet being the most popular and preferred method of purchasing holidays nowadays we need to adapt to the digital way of displaying information to target our audience. 
The value a website could bring is more customers for the site owner/sponsors and convenience for the users as many customers would rather use a website to search for their holidays now and you have all the packages supplied online in one place so you can view at home and not be inconvenienced by having to find a travel agent store. 
Who are the target audience? The site's target audience would be anyone of all ages planning a holiday and needing to search different destinations to help find what they are looking for and can refine the search by 5* hotels for example.
What I think would be worth doing is providing the users with the most popular destinations as suggestions/recommendations for the users that are looking for ideas on somewhere different to go. It is crucial in having a search function for the user to interact with to search for their destination and reveal many results of top reviewed destinations or 5* rated hotels etc. 

Why would customers want to use this website?
For the consumers I have conducted a survey on Survey Monkey (link) to analyze consumer opinions and behaviors and based on this research it is clear that…
This is a website users would return to and may return to numerous times depending on how many holidays they want to book or if they are undecided on a destination or looking for suitable holiday package. 
It would even be something that the site owner uses themselves as it is applicable to everyone so the site owner would benefit from the commission on package purchases but also from being a user of the site themselves if needed.
	- What they like about the style/design?
	- When users go to the website, where do they go first?
	- Ask users why would they/would not use the website?
	- In terms of the site owner's needs we need to look at what makes a good ecommerce experience, after some independent reseach I noticed on many articles including on the travel engine website (link included in resources section) What facilities does it need? - travel packages
	- What does it compare to other websites? - the content relavant?


Why are we special?

What are other sites doing?
What are the pros/cons of what they are doing?
What could be better?
What are the tech considerations?
Is the technology appropraite? mention api key that will be hidden 
Do theirs look better because of better resources?

## UX

### Colour Scheme

For the design of the page my aim is to create a design that uses the colours associated with the background image throughout the site, allowing the website design to flow and be seen as one complete consistent theme. The main colours in the callout background image are orange(#E54575), black(#212529) and shades of pink(#f7b81f), which I think compliment each other very well, as the vibrant pink and orange work well in creating the warm summer feel, but are also eye-catching for the user.
The black and white opposite colours are then used to inform or guide the users to the information/features they are looking for such as search inputs, brand logo, headings but also to the information we want the user to be drawn to such as travel packages etc.
The reason I selected this image was mainly due to its modern style and colours which I think create a great reflection of holidays and as part of the survey I conducted with Survey Monkey (link provided in the source) one of the questions was a choice of 2 designs with one being the background I have used with the flamingo image. The majority of users picked this image and it was interesting to see that many of the older audience also picked this image and the reasons given were that the image is modern, fun and appealing due to its colours.

- `#212529` used for primary text.
- `#E54575` used for primary buttons and cards.
- `#f7b81f` used for background and footer.
- `#ffffff` used for logo, inputs and sections.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/212529-e54575-f7b81f-ffffff) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

As you can see below I have chosen the fonts DM Serif, Poppins and Font awesome to use social media icons. When users have a page that contains a lot of text using icons can break up the page visually for the user and this is why I chose to use icons for the footer feature of the page rather than text. 
The DM Serif font is used for the logo and heading mainly as it is bold to make a statement and stand out but also has elegant serifs which represents the fun but sophisticated style we are looking to target the range of our audience' ages.
Poppins has been used for the informative text in the website with a simple style so that its readable and clear for the users. 

- [DM Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Serif+Text?query=DM+) was used for the headers and logo.

- [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Wireframes

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.

## Features

### Existing Features

- **Logo & search bar/form**

    - For the logo as mentioned in the typography section I have chosen the DM Serif font for the logo because I wanted a simple bold text logo so it does not take the users attention away from the page too much but is also readable for all ages. The value the logo will bring is the representation of the company with the simple text with a touch of elegant serifs to represent the luxury in the holidays.
    - The form is integral to the site as it allows the users to interact with it to achieve the results they are looking for which are the requested holiday packages that relates to their chosen city destination. The form is a simple format that has two inputs to firstly select their choice of country and then bring a pre populated list of the countries cities, making it user friendly as we bring the information to them depending on users choices. The form is also full reponsive so its compatible on most device sizes meaning it can be widely accessed.

- **Background image**

    - The background image is for aesthetic to make the website look visually appealing and fun. When users are seaching for holidays they are usually excited and happy, so the background image used is bright, fun and colourful to match the users feelings when they visit. The value a good designed site can bring is a good impression and returning customers due to it's memorable design and so the effective use of colour and imagery is important on the callout.

![screenshot](documentation/feature2.jpg)

- **Map & footer**

    - The value and purpose of the footer holds the links to any social media pages or contact information which can increase following on social media or direct users easily contact information if they have any queries. I have used the orange/yellow colour from the callout page background image on the footer so the colour scheme carries through the website but it works very well as it gives a highlighted effect making it noticeable for users.

### Future Features

- Add a refine option #1
    - Give more options to the customers of defining what they are looking for e.g attractions, museums, restaurants etc. Maybe this could just be simply another dropdown with the options. 
- Testimonials #2
    - Add customer reviews option on the cards so that users can see first hand reviews of the generated hotels.
- Contact Page #3
    - A contact page would be useful so we can include an email option to email us with any queries to make the site for user friendly as they will not have to leave our site to go to an external sites such a gmail if they want to email us with a query. This also gives customers another simple contact method as not all users like to call for information.
