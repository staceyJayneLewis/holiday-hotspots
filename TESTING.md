# Testing

Return back to the [README.md](README.md) file.

## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

| Page | W3C URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fstaceyjaynelewis.github.io%2Fholiday-hotspots%2F) | ![screenshot](documentation/html-validation.jpg) | Pass: No errors or warnings to show |

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

| File | Jigsaw URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| style.css | [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fstaceyjaynelewis.github.io%2Fholiday-hotspots%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en) | ![screenshot](documentation/css-validation.jpg) ![screenshot](documentation/css-validation-2.jpg) | Pass: No Errors - many warnings of the bootstrap built in components but no error or warnings on my own code |

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files.

Repeat for all other tests, as applicable to your own site.
The aforementioned tests are just an example of a few different project scenarios.

## User Story Testing

Testing user stories is actually quite simple, once you've already got the stories defined on your README.

Most of your project's **features** should already align with the **user stories**,
so this should as simple as creating a table with the user story, matching with the re-used screenshot
from the respective feature.

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### JavaScript (Jest Testing)

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

Adjust the code below (file names, etc.) to match your own project files/folders.

üõëüõëüõëüõëüõë END OF NOTES (to be deleted) üõëüõëüõëüõëüõë

I have used the [Jest](https://jestjs.io) JavaScript testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to work with Jest, I first had to initialize NPM.

- `npm init`
- Hit `enter` for all options, except for **test command:**, just type `jest`.

Add Jest to a list called **Dev Dependencies** in a dev environment:

- `npm install --save-dev jest`

**IMPORTANT**: Initial configurations

When creating test files, the name of the file needs to be `file-name.test.js` in order for Jest to properly work.

Due to a change in Jest's default configuration, you'll need to add the following code to the top of the `.test.js` file:

```js
/**
 * @jest-environment jsdom
 */

const { test, expect } = require("@jest/globals");
const { function1, function2, function3, etc. } = require("../script-name");

beforeAll(() => {
    let fs = require("fs");
    let fileContents = fs.readFileSync("index.html", "utf-8");
    document.open();
    document.write(fileContents);
    document.close();
});
```

Remember to adjust the `fs.readFileSync()` to the specific file you'd like you test.
The example above is testing the `index.html` file.

Finally, at the bottom of the script file where your primary scripts are written, include the following at the bottom of the file.
Make sure to include the name of all of your functions that are being tested in the `.test.js` file.

```js
if (typeof module !== "undefined") module.exports = {
    function1, function2, function3, etc.
};
```

Now that these steps have been undertaken, further tests can be written, and be expected to fail initially.
Write JS code that can get the tests to pass as part of the Red-Green refactor process.

Once ready, to run the tests, use this command:

- `npm test`

**NOTE**: To obtain a coverage report, use the following command:

- `npm test --coverage`

Below are the results from the tests that I've written for this application:

| Test Suites | Tests | Coverage | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 passed | 16 passed | 55% | ![screenshot](documentation/js-test-coverage.png) |
| x | x | x | repeat for all remaining tests |

#### Jest Test Issues

Use this section to list any known issues you ran into while writing your Jest tests.
Remember to include screenshots (where possible), and a solution to the issue (if known).

This can be used for both "fixed" and "unresolved" issues.

### GitHub **Issues**

I have used github issues to manage my bugs and keep a tracker of the problem and how I solved them for the above bug noted above in the bug's section.
Here is the link to view my bug solving journey: https://github.com/staceyJayneLewis/holiday-hotspots/issues

**Fixed Bugs**

All previously closed/fixed bugs can be tracked [here](https://github.com/staceyJayneLewis/holiday-hotspots/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).

| Bug | Status |
| --- | --- |
| [JS Uncaught ReferenceError: `foobar` is undefined/not defined](https://github.com/staceyJayneLewis/holiday-hotspots/issues/1) | Closed |
| [Python `'ModuleNotFoundError'` when trying to import module from imported package](https://github.com/staceyJayneLewis/holiday-hotspots/issues/2) | Closed |

**Open Issues**

There are currently no open issues in github.

## Unfixed Bugs

- When validating with CSS with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug03.png)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.

- When using the amadeus api it does not retrieve the all of the data as it is a test api.
