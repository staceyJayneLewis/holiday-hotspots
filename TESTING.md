## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### JavaScript (Jest Testing)

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

Adjust the code below (file names, etc.) to match your own project files/folders.

I have used the [Jest](https://jestjs.io) JavaScript testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to work with Jest, I first had to initialize NPM.

- `npm init`
- Hit `enter` for all options, except for **test command:**, just type `jest`.

Add Jest to a list called **Dev Dependencies** in a dev environment:

- `npm install --save-dev jest`

**IMPORTANT**: Initial configurations

When creating test files, the name of the file needs to be `file-name.test.js` in order for Jest to properly work.

Due to a change in Jest's default configuration, you'll need to add the following code to the top of the `.test.js` file:

```js
/**
 * @jest-environment jsdom
 */

const { test, expect } = require("@jest/globals");
const { function1, function2, function3, etc. } = require("../script-name");

beforeAll(() => {
    let fs = require("fs");
    let fileContents = fs.readFileSync("index.html", "utf-8");
    document.open();
    document.write(fileContents);
    document.close();
});
```

Remember to adjust the `fs.readFileSync()` to the specific file you'd like you test.
The example above is testing the `index.html` file.

Finally, at the bottom of the script file where your primary scripts are written, include the following at the bottom of the file.
Make sure to include the name of all of your functions that are being tested in the `.test.js` file.

```js
if (typeof module !== "undefined") module.exports = {
    function1, function2, function3, etc.
};
```

Now that these steps have been undertaken, further tests can be written, and be expected to fail initially.
Write JS code that can get the tests to pass as part of the Red-Green refactor process.

Once ready, to run the tests, use this command:

- `npm test`

**NOTE**: To obtain a coverage report, use the following command:

- `npm test --coverage`

Below are the results from the tests that I've written for this application:

| Test Suites | Tests | Coverage | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 passed | 16 passed | 55% | ![screenshot](documentation/js-test-coverage.png) |
| x | x | x | repeat for all remaining tests |

Use this section to list any known issues you ran into while writing your Jest tests.
Remember to include screenshots (where possible), and a solution to the issue (if known).

This can be used for both "fixed" and "unresolved" issues.

## Bugs

- Background image displaying on the browser preview but on the live site it is not displaying

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug1.png)

    - To fix this, I noticed I forgot to put the ../ at the start of the URL as I am currently in the CSS folder and need to go out of that folder to get back to the assets folder.
    

- Footer not visible as it hides behind the map element (note this bug was before I removed the map feature).

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug2.png)

    - To fix this, I realised I added a width and height in the style.css page however there is already a set height and width which have been included in the iframe element and so this was confusing the code.

- Unable to retrieve the country name data from the API, its returning the whole array

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug3.png)

    - To fix this, I discovered that I could use a for loop to push the country names into an array and then I can use a for each loop to add into the option element for the dropdown.

- I want the default value of the dropdown option to display 'select a country' instead of the first country option in the list 

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug4.png)

    - To fix this, a trial and error and some research I came to the conclusion that the easiest way to resolve this would be to use the same push method as used in the for loop but use another push method before the for loop with the values of what I want in.

- API list of country and cities works on the local site but not the live site

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug5.png)
    ![screenshot](documentation/bug5a.png)

    - To fix this, I noticed after checking my paths that there was an extra end script tag and I also had a absolute file path for the js script file instead of a relative.

- Trying to get coordinates of selected city to the getCoordinates function

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug6.png)

    - To fix this, I realised that I don't need the getCoordinates function as I used data-attributes on the city options to store the longitude and latitude values pushed to the array and fetch the values by using dataset.

- On submit the cards in the popular destinations section appear but then dissapear until submit is clicked again

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug7.png)

    - To fix this, after some research I realised I needed to add a prevent default on the form as when bootstrap forms submit a form, the default behaviour is to "POST" to the given url, if no url is given it will try to post to the some url the page is currently on. I also needed to update the element to an input with the type submit instead help the default behaviour.

- The amadeus api failed to fetch the data as it does not have ok HTTP data.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug8.png)

    - To fix this, I looked into the API documentation and realised that there were certain restrictions on the api link I was using to retrieve the locations. Alternatively I found a different link for points of interest that I can use instead where I can make up to 400 call requests for free. You will see in this screenshot below that I changed the amadeus API link to another suggested link which say's 'poi' for points of interest which seems to work well for the free cities data provided with the test API.

- Getting the value of the original Dom innerHTML in the dom tree after manipulation

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug9.png)
    ![screenshot](documentation/bug9a.png)

    - To fix this, after researching the easiest method to do this, what worked for me is simply storing the element's inner HTML in a const variable so that I can refer back to that variable whenever I need the results on the page to return back to its original state. I stored the destination cards in the destinationCards variable so I can then get those particular cards to display again when user selects clear search so user does not have to use the 'refresh' on the browser itself each time they want to search a different country or city.

- Error message not hiding when I click the clear search button

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug10.png)
    ![screenshot](documentation/bug10a.png)

    - To fix this, as the method remove() did not work for me, instead I targetted the parentNode and removed the child node (which is the alert message) , rather than putting the expression in the parenthesis I stored the expression in a variable and put it in the removeChild() method. Lastly, I needed to wrap the code in an if statement as without this the code still would not work but as we contain the code in the if statement when the statement is true it will function it.

- JS `'let'` or `'const'` or `'template literal syntax'` or `'arrow function syntax (=>)'` is available in ES6 (use `'esversion: 11'`) or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug11.png)

    - To fix this, I included  /* jshint esversion: 11 */ on the top of the jsHint programme so jsHint validator recognizes the modern ES6 methods.

## Unfixed Bugs

- When validating with CSS jigsaw validator it was showing 16 error that are from the bootstrap CDN. 

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug-1.png)

    - Attempted fix: this was expected as I have used bootstrap CDN and the validator does not recognise this so it will attempt to validate the bootstrap code and throw this error. Theres nothing I can do to fix this. 

- When using the amadeus api it does not retrieve the all of the data for all cities. If the city is not in the test api data it will throw the error in the screenshot below.
    
    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug-2.png)

    - Attempted Fix: I could fix this by purchasing the api for more data, however advised by mentor no need to purchase more data as the api test data for the four cities is suffice.
